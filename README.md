# Pokemon Catcher

Fun and interactive game for web browsers that dynamically updates the HTML page using the jQuery library.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### How to Play

```
The player will have to guess the answer, just like in Word Guess. This time, though, the player will guess with numbers instead of letters. Using Pokemon to get to the correct Number without going over will get you a win. Going over the number will result in a lose.

Each Pokemon has a random value from 1-10;

The random number shown at the start of the game should be between 15 - 100;
```
